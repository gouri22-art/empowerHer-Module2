// You are working with an array of objects where each object represents a person with their name and address details. Use multi-level destructuring to extract the person's name, city, and street information.

// Steps:
// Given an array of people objects like:
// const people = [ { name: "Alice", address: { city: "New York", street: { name: "Broadway", number: 123 } } }, { name: "Bob", address: { city: "Los Angeles", street: { name: "Sunset Boulevard", number: 456 } } } ];

// Use multi-level destructuring to extract:
// name of each person.
// city and street name from the address.
// Return an array of strings in the format: "Alice lives in New York on Broadway"..
const people = [
